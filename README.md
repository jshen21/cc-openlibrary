# Open Library Books API

This app was created in response to a code challenge described here (https://gist.github.com/gooptaa/b5bf13cbd4c7b00bfacd7d0335423cb2). It is deployed at https://cc-openlibrary.herokuapp.com/.


For this challenge, I made AJAX requests to Open Library Books API to get the data to generate the React components.
